## [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria)

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## [Mock-Up](#mock-up)

## [Installation](#installation)

I started by creating a new repo on GitHub giving it a unique name and then cloning it to my local environment using GitBash. I then created a few folders to house the CSS and assets. I created an index.html file in gitbash using 'touch' and then began to work through the files coding in the html first, to create the structure, and then once sufficiently built out, I proceeded to work on the CSS. With any new major features/changes to the the code I added (git add -A) the changes, commited the changes (git commit -m " ") and then pushed them up to my remote repo on GitHub (git push origin).
